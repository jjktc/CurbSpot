## Prototype
Working nearly 54 hours straight, I built a prototype of how we envisioned the mobile and desktop interfaces to look that had working map features, location searching, and various functional screens. I worked with a professional UX designer in order to make it look sleek and streamlined, and talked with people from various companies like Capital One to influence the direction of the product. It was written using the Ionic Framework (TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS)
